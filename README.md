# Workout Tracker

Workout tracker. Created with Mongo database, Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express.
When the user loads the page, they should be given the option to create a new workout or continue with their last workout.
The user should be able to:

  * Add exercises to a previous workout plan.

  * Add new exercises to a new workout plan.

  * View the combined weight of multiple exercises on the `stats` page.

  ## User Story
  As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

  ## Business Context
  A consumer will reach their fitness goals more quickly when they track their workout progress.
